# SuperMarketCheckout
I have made a UnitTest software for supermarket Checkout in which the discount rules will apply auomatically.You just have to mention the rule forex : By 3 'A' at '130'.


If You want to add a new Rule you can use 'test_CanApplyDiscountRule' function and add your new rule like this(checkout.addDiscount("A", 3, 130).
Here A = Item
     3 = Number of item
     130 = Price of item
You can add multiple rules for multiple items.
